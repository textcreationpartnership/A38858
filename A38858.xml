            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>I Have here ſent you an Account of the Affairs of <hi>Ireland,</hi> as we have received it from Sir <hi>John Davis</hi> and others. Sir <hi>John</hi> made his Eſcape from <hi>Dablin</hi> in a Wherry, and got to the Camp at <hi>Dundalk;</hi> he left <hi>Dublin</hi> on Sunday was fortnight, and arrived here from the Camp on Tueſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day laſt: He gives a very lamentable account of the Condition that our Friends in <hi>Dublin</hi> are in, he ſays, that two days before he made his Eſcape, about fourteen Perſons were committed to Priſon for High Treaſon, for Conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the Death of the late King <hi>James,</hi> and had notice given them, that they would be proceeded againſt the firſt of the Term, which begins in <hi>Dublin No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vember</hi> 6th. He does not doubt but they will be found Guilty, right or wrong, and be executed.

                  </gap>day the 13th. Inſtant, and gives us a much better Account of things there; he ſays, that moſt of the Proteſtants are releaſed on Bail, except
<pb facs="tcp:104176:2"/>Capt. <hi>Fitz-gerald,</hi> Dr. <hi>King,</hi> Counſellor <hi>Coughlan, Mr. John Weaver, Mr. Hector Vaughan,</hi> &amp;c. Likewiſe that moſt of the Gentlemen in the County of <hi>Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meath</hi> are ſet at Liberty; but that Maſs is publickly celebrated in <hi>Chriſt-Church,</hi> St. <hi>Patrick</hi>'s Church, and the Colledge of <hi>Dublin,</hi> and in moſt of the Churches in the Country; that the Lord <hi>Dover,</hi> with the Marqueſs of <hi>Albeville,</hi> was arrived before he came away. <hi>Fuller</hi> ſays, that upon his arrival, the <hi>Iriſh</hi> were greatly dejected, in regard he had not brought with him any Aſſiſtance of men, Arms, Ammunition, or any thing elſe, which they with great impatience expected from <hi>France.</hi> The Lord <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver</hi> gives out, that they loſt a Ship la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den with Arms and Ammunition, and that the Ship he was in narrowly eſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped our <hi>Men of War,</hi> being purſued by ſome of them. <hi>Fuller</hi> likewiſe contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicts what has been reported amongſt us here, of any other Shipping being got into <hi>Ireland</hi> from <hi>France,</hi> but that the Lord <hi>Dover</hi> came in.</p>
               <p>We were not without ſome appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions, that <hi>Fuller</hi> might be come over upon ſome in Deſign, and ſo to relate things otherwiſe than they were, but we have had him carefully exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined before Sir <hi>George</hi> St. <hi>George,</hi> and cannot find any ground to ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect him. He further ſays, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the late King <hi>James</hi> broke up his Camp, they had a great Mortality a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them, and that they loſt many of their Horſe for want of Forrage and above 10000 of their Men dye<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>r Officers declare, that if they had fought, as the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Officers would have done (but were oppoſed by the <hi>French</hi>) they could not have loſt ſo many, though they had been beaten; that they have brought a very Peſtilential Fever with them to <hi>Dublin,</hi> and to other places where they are marched, of which ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny do daily dye.</p>
               <p>The Account they have in <hi>Dublin</hi> of <hi>James Town</hi> and <hi>Sligoe</hi> is very different from what our People from the Camp have given out, but indeed I do not find any of them can give an Account of the matter, for it was very uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly reported in the Camp when they came away. The Account that <hi>Fuller</hi> gives from <hi>Dublin,</hi> is, that Col. <hi>Sars<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field</hi> having a detach'd Party of 4000 men from the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Camp, was joyned by a Party of the <hi>Connaught</hi> Forces, conſiſting of 3000 more; that they marched ſtraight to <hi>James Town,</hi> in which was a Garriſon of abour 100 of our men, who having notice of their approach, quitted the place, and got ſafe 10 <hi>Sligoe,</hi> to which place <hi>Sarsfield</hi> likewiſe came, and out men there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haved themſelves ſo well, as to get off with very inconſiderable loſs. But the moſt certain Account we have, is by a Letter from one Mr. <hi>Murry,</hi> to Mr. <hi>Robert Shaw,</hi> dated at <hi>Ballyſhannon, Nov.</hi> 4. who mentions nothing of theſe par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars, but that they are all very well at <hi>Sligoe,</hi> and likewiſe in all thoſe parts.</p>
               <p>The Reports we have had about our Army, are in a great meaſure falſe; I have ſpoke with ſeveral who came from thence, that ſay, we have not loſt above 1500 men by Sickneſs, that ſeveral are ſickly, but in a good po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture of Recovery, our Army being gone into their Winter Quarters. Our <hi>Dutch</hi> and <hi>French</hi> Souldiers are very well, the Country agreeing extreamly well with them, few or none of them being ſick.</p>
               <p>Our Army is very well furniſhed with all ſorts of Proviſions from our Ships, and from the North; Forrage is ſomewhat ſcarce for our Horſe, but that is ſupplyed by the great plenty of Graſs every where, and a ſufficient ſtock of Oats, which our Ships con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly furniſh.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fuller</hi> ſays, that Salt is ſold in <hi>Dub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin</hi> at 9 <hi>l.</hi> the Hogſhead, and they ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally Report, that they have very little Ammunition.
